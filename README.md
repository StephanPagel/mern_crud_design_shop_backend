# fullstack_crud_design_shop_backend

This is a fullstack CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) project in the form of an online shop. The technologies used in the backend are:

* JavaScript
* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB

The project is still under construction. As soon as it is finished, I will provide the deployment link here.

Many greetings Stephan
